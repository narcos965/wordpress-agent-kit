## 📚 What’s Included?

The wordpress-agent-kit provides these core parts:

- **AGENTS.md**: A key markdown file focused on WordPress agent instructions. It explains how AI agents can interact with WordPress to perform common tasks.
- **Agent Skills Starter Pack**: Pre-designed skills for agents like Claude and GitHub Copilot. These skills help AI understand and assist with WordPress development.
- **Example Workflows**: Sample scenarios showing how to use AI agents for basic WordPress tasks such as plugin management, theme customization, and content updates.

## 🔍 How It Works

The software uses text-based agent files (AGENTS.md) to tell AI coding agents what tasks to perform related to WordPress. The agent skills provide templates and prompts to guide AI tools in delivering useful code or suggestions.

You interact with the kit by choosing tasks or inputting simple instructions. The AI then generates code snippets, commands, or configuration changes.

You can review the AI outputs before applying them, allowing you to stay in control.

## 💡 Helpful Tips

- Keep the kit folder organized. Avoid moving files once you have started using the tool.
- Regularly check the GitHub releases page for updates or new agent skill packs.
- Use the example workflows as templates for your own WordPress projects.
- If the AI generates code, test it on a separate WordPress setup before applying it live.
- Explore the AGENTS.md file to understand how tasks get structured.
